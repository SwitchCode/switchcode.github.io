description: "8-Bit Robot Music Party (8RMP) is a rythm/platform game where you and your friend (we hope you have any) help your third (virtual) friend who is stuck in the game. The first player has to deal with the music like a Guitar Hero while the second plays, mario-style, with the little robot Everbot. The players must finish the level before the end of the music."

history: "This game was made during INNOV'Game organized by EFREI, (engineer school). This contest was announced during october 2010. We first made a document which permit us to be selected for the 2nd round.

Despite the time, we never could write all those features we wanted but most have been done!"
